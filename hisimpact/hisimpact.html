        <p>Piero Fornasetti impacted the way art is percieved through the world. He re-created the same painting over and over, just to prove that beauty can be replicated millions of times and still be just as beautiful. He went on to pursue carreers in architecture, furniture design, and also kitchen wear. From his experience with Lina, he went on to expand his artistic creativity. He learned a whole new world of art, which artists now take inspiration from. Wether it's creating multiple prints, adding them onto abnormal surfaces, or simply pushing the boundries within art.</p>
