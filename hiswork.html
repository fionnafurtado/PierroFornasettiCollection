        <p>His work began with mainly paintings and designs. But his first recongnition pieces came from his admiration for architecture. Fornasetti worked with Italian and other European furniture designers in the beginning of his career. He began to fall in love with the process of designing furniture. His pieces can still be sold today at select art dealerships.</p>
